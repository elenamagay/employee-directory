## Description

This week my assignment was to create an employee directory with React.

## User Story
As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Installation

```
npm init -y
npm i bootstrap
npm i react
npm i react-dom
npm i axios

```
## React App Deployment

First specify the `homepage` and add some scripts to the `package.json`:
```
"homepage": "https://elenamagay.github.io/employee-directory",
```
```
"predeploy": "npm run build",
"deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
```
Then run:
```
npm run deploy
```
